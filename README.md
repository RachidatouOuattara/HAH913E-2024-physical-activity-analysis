#**Physical Activity for Health - Digital Sciences Analysis**

## **Overview**  
This project aims to analyze physical activity data using digital tools to provide actionable insights for improving health. The work focuses on processing raw acceleration data from recording devices, extracting meaningful measurements, and interpreting them to generate practical health advice.  

The project is part of the HAH913E course, which emphasizes skill development in physical activity analysis through the use of Python and GitHub.

## **Objectives**  
1. Collect and process raw data from physical activity recordings.  
2. Ensure data quality through robust validation techniques.  
3. Analyze the data to derive key metrics, such as activity levels and patterns.  
4. Visualize the findings using clear, interpretable charts and graphs.  
5. Provide practical health advice based on the analysis results.

## **Project Structure**  
- **`main.ipynb`**: The entry point for running the entire project demonstration.  
- **`notebooks/`**: Contains Jupyter notebooks used during the development phase.  
- **`data/`**: Includes all raw data files used for analysis.  
- **`results/`**: Stores the final outputs and visualizations generated from the analysis.  

Each directory contains a `readme.md` file describing its contents.
